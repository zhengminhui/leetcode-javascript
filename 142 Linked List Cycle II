        The distance of fast is X+mY+K, dis of slow is X+nY+k. The velocity of them are 2 and 1.
        So we can deduce that X+K = (m-2n)Y. From this we can know that, if slow start from head again and fast goes from the K point. They will meet again at a point P. That point P is the place where cycles starts.
